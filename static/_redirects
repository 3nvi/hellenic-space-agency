## All the i18n redirects are automatically added. We are manually making sure `/admin` doesn't get
## redirected by our `/*` catch-all redirect. We need that because there's no `admin` page under
## `/src/pages` since `/admin` is created for us internally via gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms

/admin              /admin
